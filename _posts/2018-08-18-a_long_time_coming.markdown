I was born in 82'. I got my first computer in about 90' as a hand me down early model IBM from my grandfather. He owned a pretty sucessfull business as a shoe wholesaler and used computers for inventory and invoicing. It was outdated technology at the time with it's 5 1/4 floppy disk and green monochomatic screen and dot matrix printer but I spent hours sitting in front of it basically learning DOS becasue thats all there was. I had one floppy with a work processor on it. 

One day my brother from another mother (litterally) brought me some floppys of a game called Space Quest.

The game blew me away. I had no idea this machine with this blinkiing cursor to do so much. Computers would become my go to indoor entertainment option. 

As years went on and my grandfather saw my interest in computers he started giving me his personal computer handme downs every year or two when he upgraded. Then one day I received my first 14.4k bps modem. I spent countless nights connecting to dial up BBSs and exploring this new digital world. I was hooked.  
 
I wanted to know and learn everything about computers but no one I knew had any interest. Certainly no one I knew at the time knew more about computers than I already learned on my own. I look many times at learning to code. Coding just seemeed so complicated. Sure, I learned some HTML and a little CSS eventually but that was it. I remember how excited I was when a new highschool I was going to offered a computer programming class on macs. It was the only class i liked but due to a divorce I did not spend more than a single quarter in that school. 

I ended up gravetating more towards hardwear because it was easier. I started upgrading my computers and fixing them for peope and even building my own from parts. I always wanted to learn programming but I just never did. I tried a few tutorials here and there but it just didnt come natural to me and without any real supoprt I guess I just figured it was poinless to try. Still, I did try many many tutorials over the next 15 years. I looked an every language probably but alwasy got hung up on syntax. I hate inefficency and it was just really annoying all these littel nuances that on it's face make no sense. Why do I need a semicolon there? 

Randomly one day a few years ago I looked at Ruby. Maybe it was the simplistic nature of the syntax or maybe it was just the right time in my life but I enjoyed the tutarial and found myself wanting more. I came across the  flatiron platform and found it to be intuitive and and the feeback/testing with the IDE wa exactly what I needed. So I am here...
